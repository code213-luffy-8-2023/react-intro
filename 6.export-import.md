# import, export

Up to now we have been writing all our code in a single file. This is fine for small programs, but as your programs get larger, it becomes unwieldy to have all the code in one file. To allow us to break our code up into multiple files, we use the `import` and `export` keywords.


## Exporting

To export a variable, function, or class, we use the `export` keyword. For example, if we have a file called `math.js` that contains the following code:

```js
export const add = (a, b) => a + b
export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b
```

We can import the `add` and `subtract` functions in another file like this:

```js

import { add, subtract } from './math.js'

console.log(add(1, 2)) // 3
console.log(subtract(1, 2)) // -1
```

### Named vs Default Exports

In the previous example, we used named exports. We can also use default exports. For example, if we have a file called `math.js` that contains the following code:

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b
const subtract = (a, b) => a - b

export default {
    add,
    subtract,
}
```

We can import the `add` and `subtract` functions in another file like this:

```js
import math from './math.js'

console.log(math.add(1, 2)) // 3

console.log(math.subtract(1, 2)) // -1
```

*You can only have one default export per file.*
*You can have as many named exports as you want per file.*


## Importing

To import a variable, function, or class, we use the `import` keyword. For example, if we have a file called `math.js` that contains the following code:

```js
export const add = (a, b) => a + b
export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b
```

We can import the `add` and `subtract` functions in another file like this:

```js
import { add, subtract } from './math.js'

console.log(add(1, 2)) // 3
console.log(subtract(1, 2)) // -1
```

To import an external package or library, we use the name of that package instead of the file name

```js
import React from 'react'
```
