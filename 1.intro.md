## Why React?

Every framework/library or service was created to solve a problem, and React is no different, React was created to solve the problem of building large applications with data that changes over time. React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components, which present data that changes over time.

## How does React work?

React creates a virtual DOM. When state changes in a component it firstly runs a "diffing" algorithm, which identifies what has changed in the virtual DOM. The second step is reconciliation, where it updates the DOM with the results of diff.
