# 1. Incrementing a counter

Create A counter App

## Steps: 

1. Create a new react app using the following command:

    ```

    Then follow the instructions in the command line to create a react app.

2. Remove all the boilerplate code (index.css content, App.css content, App.jsx Component content)

3. In The `App.jsx` `App` component create a state variable called `counter` and initialize it with the value `0`

4. Display the value of the `counter` state variable in the `App` component
5. Add a button to the `App` component that when clicked will increment the value of the `counter` state variable by 1
6. Add a button to the `App` component that when clicked will decrement the value of the `counter` state variable by 1
