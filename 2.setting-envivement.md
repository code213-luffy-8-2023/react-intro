# Setting up envirement


## Install NodeJS

1. Download the installer from [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Always make sure you downloaded the LTS version
3. Install NodeJS

Once your installation is over, verify that NodeJS is install by running the following command in your terminal/cmd:

```bash
node -v
# should return the version of installed node 18.xx
```

## Installing pnpm

Node js comes with `npm` which is the default package manager for node js, but we will be using `pnpm` which is a faster as it offers better disk space utilization and network performance. (Trust me you will thank me later)

to install `pnpm` run the following command in your terminal/cmd:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

**Note**: `pnpm` offers the same commands as `npm` so you can use `pnpm` instead of `npm` in all the commands in any tutorial you find online.

so for example if you find a tutorial that says run `npm install react` you can run `pnpm install react` instead.
