# React State

## What is React State?

React state is a special type of variables, that has apecial properties, like being reactive, meaning when ever this function changes the compenent that uses it will be re-rendered to reflect the new value of the state.


### Using State

To use State in a functional component we use the `useState` hooks (More about hooks later)

```jsx

const MyReactComponent = () => {
    const [name, setName] = useState('Ahmed')

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello {name}</h1>
        </div>
    )
}

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <MyReactComponent />
        </div>
    )
}
```

### Updating State

To update the state we use the function returned from the `useState` hook, this function will take the new value of the state as an argument.

```jsx

const MyReactComponent = () => {
    const [name, setName] = useState('Ahmed')

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello {name}</h1>
            <button onClick={() => setName('Mohamed')}>Change Name</button>
        </div>
    )
}

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <MyReactComponent />
        </div>
    )
}
```

The `setter` function of a state can be used to update the state in two ways:

1. By passing the new value of the state as an argument to the function

    ```jsx
    setName('Mohamed')
    ```

2. By passing a function that takes the current value of the state as an argument and returns the new value of the state

    ```jsx
    setName((currentName) => currentName + ' Mohamed')
    ```

**Note**: A State Variable Passed to a component will also be reactive;
